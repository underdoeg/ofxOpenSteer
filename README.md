# ofxOpenSteer #
Openframeworks lightweight wrapper for the opensource steering behaviors library [OpenSteer](http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/).

This addon is based and inspired by it's [original fork](https://github.com/underdoeg/ofxOpenSteer) by [Philip Whitfield](https://github.com/underdoeg), but have diverged a bit (a bit more modular and some redundancies were removed). When I feel it's more complete I will propose a pull request.

This is quite an early stage so, for now, no instructions in here (the example app is quite easy to understand), but a few screen shots of the sample simulations:
